Task List
Traditional time-planners are nothing more than interfaces which capture information regarding your tasks and availability 
of time, thus ultimately making YOU do all the planning. This can get time-consuming and complicated, especially and ironically 
when you have a lot of things to do. Task List aims to provide a smart, automated and easy to use system to solve this problem, 
where you need to input the minimal amount of information regarding your tasks, priorities and time availability and rest 
everything is done automatically. 

Ease of use will be achieved through a UI that tries to minimize the number of actions required from a user to update, edit, 
delay, or complete a given task. Through push notifications and a page in the app dedicated to task modifications, the app will 
minimize the number of actions required to both reach the desired task and edit it. Tasks will be sorted in a number of views 
such as simple list, calendar, or category form. Different categories will be built around various criteria such as the nature 
of the task in terms of its goal (health/fitness, chores/errands, academic, work related, etc.) and in terms of its timing 
(fixed deadline, can be delayed, daily task, one-time task, etc.). Users will also be able to modify/create certain fields and 
categories.

The app is based on time-scheduling using the Simplex method to optimize over-all utility. By using the categories of the task 
combined with its importance, the app will sort the tasks and send suggestions about which task merits attention. The app will 
keep track of productivity and efficiency by prompting user for estimated time required and actual time spent. Furthermore, 
the app will take into account your behavioral tendencies, time of day etc. to further enhance the suggestion system. The app 
has the potential to combine location criteria such as distance to a task to add to the suggestion engine as well.
